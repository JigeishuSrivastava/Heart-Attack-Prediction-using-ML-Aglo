ðŸš€Heart Attack Prediction Using Machine Learning ðŸ’»

- Objective

One of the most prominent causes of death around the globe is heart attack. Though preventable, earlier detection can save a life. Towards this aim, I developed a Heart Attack Prediction System employing various machine learning models and examined the best candidate models.

Key Highlights of the Project



1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I utilized Pandas Profiling on dataset for detailed exploration.

An interactive report was quickly generated containing statistical summaries, correlation matrices, missing values, and visual insights.

It was helpful in reading the data trends, relationship between features, and it can alert you to potential anomalies.



2. Machine Learning Models Implemented

K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier (KNN): This performed really well, particularly due to its simplicity and effectiveness in dealing with non-linear decision boundaries.

Support Vector Classifier (SVC): This uses the concept of hyperplane optimization to separate data points efficiently and has shown great accuracy.

After trying different algorithms, the ones that performed the best regarding accuracy and reliability were KNN and SVC.



3. Evaluation Metrics

The task was to determine which model made the most accurate predictions on test data.

Confusion Matrix: Evaluates the true positives and false positives to assess the performance of the model.

Precision & Recall: Ensured the balance between sensitivity and specificity for real-world applicability.



* Technical Stack Used

Python: Core programming language for implementation.

Pandas Profiling: For EDA and automated insights.

Sklearn: For building, training, and validating the machine learning models.



* Key Learnings

The importance of feature selection in improving model accuracy.

Use of automated EDA tools such as Pandas Profiling makes the journey toward understanding the data much faster.

The impact of hyperparameters on the performance of models such as SVC is monumental.



- Results and Impact

The project gave high accuracy results with the SVC and KNN classifiers, thus showing the potential of machine learning in healthcare. This system might be a small step toward better decision support for medical practitioners.
